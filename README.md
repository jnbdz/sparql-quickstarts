The [d3sparql.js](http://biohackathon.org/d3sparql/d3sparql.js) library provides functions executing a SPARQL query by [Ajax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) call (XMLHttpRequest) and visulaizing results by the [D3 library](http://d3js.org/). Basically, this library transforms the [SPARQL Query Results JSON Format](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-json/) (aka. application/sparql-results+json) into several JSON formats which major D3 layouts can accept. Many of the examples are borrowed from [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/) and [bost.ocks.org](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/). The d3sparql.js library is distributed under the same license as D3.js's ([BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)).*
